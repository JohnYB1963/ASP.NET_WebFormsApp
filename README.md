# ASP.NET_WebFormsApp
This app utilizes the code scaffolding built into Visual Studio.
I added LINQ functionality to connect to my sql server database. 
In addition, I implemented a coremessaging web service class with which the front end makes AJAX calls to the back end via webmethods.
I also added additional functionality to the app to streamline user experience.
